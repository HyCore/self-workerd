# self-workerd

This is a proof-of-concept on how you can build and self-host a complete FaaS architecture.

This project is based on [workerd](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the V8-based JavaScript runtime that powers Cloudflare Workers.

And, for a real scenario, it uses [Fly](https://fly.io) as cloud provider, where the FaaS is hosted. It relies on container-based deployment.
